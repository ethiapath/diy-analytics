# DIY Analytics

Get simple insights into your website's traffic, and do not pay for them! This 
project bridges the gap between free analytics services:

- :raised_hands: they're free,
- :lock: but offer no control over the data,
- :no_entry: require yet another account,
- :scream_cat: and their UI can be overwhelming;

and paid analytics services:

- :sunglasses: they're generally slick,
- :moneybag: but they're paid,
- :money_with_wings: and, worse than that, the pricing plans tend to not 
account at all for websites that make no or little revenue.
